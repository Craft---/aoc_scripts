# Age of Conan Game Scripts
Holds the custom scripts for use in AoC mmo. Most included are utility scripts for pugs and finding groups.

Use: Copy  any of the scripts to your `Age of Conan\Scripts` directory. In game simply type `/<scriptname>`. Most of these have been tested in game but I'm tweaking them regularly and adding more syntax highlighting and more scripts. As such if any are broken feel free to open an issue here and I'll correct for anyone using them or if you'd like to add a script for others to use open a Pull Request!
